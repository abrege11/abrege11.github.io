    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <p>
    <h3><a href="./blob/main/quantum-algorithm-education/src/pages/index.html">Quantum Algorithm Education</a> - <i>HTML, CSS, Javascript</i><br></h3>
    QAE is a project that I made to document my summer quantum algorithm studies. I find that the best way for me to learn, is to teach, so I made this website to display my understanding of these algorithms, while also educating myself.

    <p>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/abrege11/leetcode-api">Leetcode API</a> - <i>Node.js, GraphQL</i><br></h3>
    This was an API that I created for a web app that I wanted to make that would act as a Strava for programming to track progress in projects. While the project's development is on standby due to my preparation for graduate school, I still find the idea useful. <br><br>
    Although it isn't anything crazy, I wanted this to be a project that showcases the best practices I've learned from my internship at Northcross Group. Along with a peek into my Node.js capabilities.

    <p>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/abrege11/cpp-lexer">Language Lexer</a> - <i>C++</i><br></h3>
    This is a lexer built in C++ that can tokenize: Functions, Types, Arrays, Arithmetic Expressions, etc. This was a great
    exercise to learn about the low-level aspect of programing languages that can be so far overlooked while working with
    higher level languages.

    <h3><a href="">Brege Lift Tracker</a> - <i>Swift</i><br></h3>
    <img src="./assets/BRE.png" id="icon"> <br>
    I would consider lifting to be a large hobby in my life. I knew that there was already lift tracker apps available, but I wanted to make my own. So I did, and it's a great way for me to track progress in my lifts. An app I use everyday and one that I am proud of.

    <h3><a href="">Brege Macronutrient Calculator</a> - <i>Swift</i><br></h3>
    <img src="./assets/icontemplatemacro.png" id="icon"><br>
    While this app isn't used a frequently for me. Whenever I want to switch my calorie intake to switch from a bulk, to a cut, or even a maintenance, this is the app I go for immediately. <br><br>
    Again, made in Swift, I took the top 3 methods of calculating macronutrient information, and averaged them out to get the most accurate number to ensure my progress in the gym.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/abrege11/nba-players-salary-chart">NBA Player Salary Chart - Webscraping</a> - <i>Python, PHP, MySQL</i></h3>
    This is a project that I made for my CS495 class at NMU. It uses PHP to webscrape salary, and weight data, linking them in an SQL database, and displaying the link between an NBA players weight and salary. <br><br>
    I see this as a gag concept, but the technical skills that I learned to pull it off were very useful in my development journey.<br><br>
     Below is a short demo, which shows the capabilities of the chart to scale up and down depending on the weight entered. <br><br>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/abrege11/nbaplayersgui">NBA Player Years Played - Webscraping</a> - <i>Python, Beautiful Soup, tkinter</i><br></h3>
    This is a smaller application that I added a GUI onto with tkinter to show the years that a player actively played in the NBA. This was my first webscraping project, and while it's not the fastest, it gave me a great introduction to the practice.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/abrege11/imageprocessingV1">Image Processing</a> - <i>Python</i><br></h3>
    Bored at work one summer, I had a free afternoon and wanted to mess around with image processing as I had kept hearing about all of the fun things people were doing with it. It was a fun project that I used to detect my friends faces, and a fun one to show off.
